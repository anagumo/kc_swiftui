## 🍻Testing

This project has at least 50% of covergae

Some issues I found adding unit test in each feature:

* URL error since the "vi/public" should be placed in each endpoint, the path is versioning
* Decoding error since the paramas of root JSON and data are mandatory
* After this the request succeed, the Agent Zero is the first result
